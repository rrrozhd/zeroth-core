"""Backend-conditional async lease manager for durable run dispatch.

Supports two claiming strategies:
- **Postgres**: ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` for contention-free
  multi-worker claiming.  No verify step needed.
- **SQLite**: Timestamp-expiry UPDATE with a verify re-read (the existing
  approach).  Works for single-node deployments.

Each pending run is claimed by a worker via an atomic operation that sets
lease columns.  If a worker crashes, its lease expires and another worker
can reclaim the run.  The lease is renewed periodically while the run is
executing.
