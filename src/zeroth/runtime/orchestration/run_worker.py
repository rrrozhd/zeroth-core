"""Durable run worker that replaces asyncio.create_task dispatch.

A RunWorker polls SQLite for PENDING runs, claims them via lease, drives them
through the RuntimeOrchestrator, and releases the lease on completion.  On
startup it reclaims any orphaned RUNNING runs whose leases have expired.

The worker runs as a single asyncio background task started in the app lifespan.
Graceful shutdown cancels the poll loop without interrupting runs that are
currently executing (the semaphore ensures bounded concurrency).

        The accepted cost is churn: under *permanent* contention the run cycles
        PENDING → RUNNING → PENDING instead of settling. That is deliberate.
        Routing it through ``dead_letter_manager`` or bumping ``failure_count``
        would count platform contention as run failure and re-derive the same
