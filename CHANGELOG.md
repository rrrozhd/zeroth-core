## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-13

v4.0 Platform Extensions — production-grade agentic workflow capabilities.

### Added

- **Subgraph composition** — nest published graphs as SubgraphNodes with governance inheritance, thread participation modes, approval propagation, and cycle detection (90 tests).
- **Parallel fan-out/fan-in** — split execution across branches with budget isolation, configurable merge strategies, and SubgraphNode-in-parallel guard (55 tests).
- **Template registry** — CRUD REST API for prompt templates with audit-safe secret redaction, `TemplateRegistry.delete()` method (59 tests).
- **Context window management** — token tracking with pluggable compaction strategies and thread persistence (68 tests).
- **Resilient HTTP client** — retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker, rate limiting, and connection pooling (62 tests).
- **Artifact store** — content-addressed storage with TTL refresh, GET REST endpoint (auth-protected).
- v4.0 concept documentation pages for all six new subsystems.
- OpenAPI spec synced with v4.0 endpoints (artifact GET, template CRUD).
- Phase 39 manual verification tests with real SQLite persistence.

### Changed

- README updated with v4.0 capabilities section and architecture diagram.
- `TemplateRegistry` DELETE endpoint now uses `registry.delete()` instead of accessing private `_templates` dict.
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table populated with all 36 v4.0 requirement IDs.
- Configuration reference docs regenerated for new settings.

### Fixed

- E501 line-too-long in `parallel/executor.py`.
- I001 unsorted imports in `service/app.py`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-11

First public PyPI release of `zeroth-core`, the governed multi-agent runtime
library extracted from the Zeroth platform. This release establishes the
OSS-grade metadata, optional dependency extras, and trusted-publisher release
pipeline required for a stable PyPI presence.

### Added

- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` file at repo root (canonical text).
- `CHANGELOG.md` in keepachangelog 1.1.0 format.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with dev setup, PR conventions, issue filing, and license guidance.
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker under `src/zeroth/core/` — downstream users now receive type hints out of the box.
- `[project.urls]` block in `pyproject.toml` (Homepage, Source, Issues, Changelog).
- PyPI classifiers and keywords for searchability and discoverability.
- `examples/hello.py` — minimal runnable fixture (PKG-06 acceptance) that proves a clean-venv install of `zeroth-core` produces a working program.
- Optional dependency extras carved out of the base dependency list:
  `[memory-pg]`, `[memory-chroma]`, `[memory-es]`, `[dispatch]`, `[sandbox]`, and `[all]` (PKG-03).
- GitHub Actions trusted-publisher release workflow (`release-zeroth-core.yml`) with TestPyPI staging, clean-venv smoke-install gate, and Sigstore attestations (PKG-05).

### Changed

- Dependencies carved into a minimal base plus six optional extras. Installing
  bare `zeroth-core` no longer transitively pulls `psycopg`, `pgvector`,
  `chromadb-client`, `elasticsearch`, `redis`, or `arq` — each backend is
  opt-in via its extra.
- Build backend bumped to `hatchling>=1.27` for PEP 639 SPDX
  `license-expression` support.
- Hatchling wheel target verified for the PEP 420 namespace layout introduced
  in Phase 27. The existing `packages = ["src/zeroth"]` target was kept
  unchanged after confirming it produces a correctly-rooted `zeroth/core/`
  wheel with no stray top-level `zeroth/__init__.py`.
